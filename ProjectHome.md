ecuExplorer is an open-source application that will connect to a Subaru ECU; 1999 model and onwards.

It can provide many diagnostic information parameters as well as being able to request user-defined parameters from the connected ECU.

It also has ECUFlash integration which will allow you to download the current ROM image off the ECU, compare a ROM image to what is currently loaded on the ECU and upload a new ROM image to the ECU.  ECUFlash is another open-source initiative supplied from openecu.org.

The source code is for an unreleased v3.0.28. The binary download is for v3.0.25; the last released version.

THIS APPLICATION IS NO LONGER BEING DEVELOPED. I HAVE NOT TOUCHED THE CODE SINCE COMMITTING IT TO GOOGLE CODE NOR AM I AWARE OF ANY THIRD PARTY DEVELOPMENT. USE IT AS IT IS.
